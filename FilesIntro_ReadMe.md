# ChIPSeqAnalysis

The scripts for data cleaning, pipeline process and plotting are contained within the "Scripts" folder under "Factors", "Markers" and "Factor_Marker" sub-folders for the hepatic factors & gene markers relevant for this analysis along with their location overlap identification.

The raw data files (obtained from open sources) and the intermediate data processing pipeline files and the process result files used for the steps that followed have not been included. These can be accessed or created as relevant/necessary. The scripts included within the "Factors" folder serve as the template for those respective steps performed on the list of gene markers as well. 

The overall reference papers and images for the projects are in the "Papers" and "Images" folders.
